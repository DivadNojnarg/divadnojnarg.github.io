      <title>Track a website usage with hotjar</title>

      <description>A web tracking tool I often use is hotjar. Below is a heatmap showing all the users click in the past week in my personal website. I am keen on this kind of feedback since it summarizes everything at a glance. The screenshot you can see only takes into account click events. However, you can also see users moves or how they scroll on your website.

The table below shows where your visitors are from, how much time they spend on a given page, with which web browser and when.</description>

      <title>Build awesome dashboards with shiny</title>

      <description>Introduction shinydashboard is without any doubt a great package. However, most of the dashboard I see almost look the same. However, one does not have to forget that shinydashboard is built upon the famous free adminLTE2 dashboard template (that uses boostrap 3). Indeed, if you look a the shinydashboard github repository, there is a folder inst/AdminLTE.
From R to HTML You probably know that when you write a R shiny code, such as sliderInput, shiny will generate the corresponding HTML code, to be integrate into an html page.</description>

      <title>Extend shinyWidgets: knobInput</title>

      <description>Introduction shiny basic package contains several widgets, available here. This database is continuously extended through the shinyWidget package developed by the dreamRs team. Here I present how we add a new knobInput widget to shinyWidget, with Victor Perrier from the dreamRs team.
I always wanted to play with some knobs in shiny, similarly as what we do with sliders. However, in spite of some research, I found nothing already implemented.</description>

      <title>How to customize shiny sliderInput</title>
      <link>https://divadnojnarg.github.io/blog/customsliderinput/</link>

      <description>Sometimes, you might get bored by the design of the sliders in Shiny. This input widget uses the Ion.Rangeslider js library. In the advanced section, you can notice that 5 themes are actually available. I really like the flat ui skin. In this tutorial, I will describe two ways to install new themes for your shiny sliders (a third way is in development)
Create your own input-slider.R function At the moment, this is my favorite option since it does not alter the shiny package code directly.</description>

      <description>After several months of silence (I am very busy :)), I would like to share with you a &amp;ldquo;best of&amp;rdquo; of all Shiny packages you might need to build beautiful and powerful applications.
Enhance your apps with Javascript (still updated) The shinyjs package was designed by Dean Attali, https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/, a very famous shiny user. In summary, it allows you to add interactivity inside your app for example:
 hide/show/toggle widgets, graphs, tables reset inputs to their initial value enable/disable elements  These are the most outstanding properties of this package and require just a few lines of code to work.</description>

      <title>Setting MathJax with Hugo</title>

      <description>The classical approach MathJax is a javascript library which allows the user to integrate math expressions in a website or a blog. However, its configuration can be quite complex for beginners. In my previous website powered by Jekyll, I easily managed to install MathJax, whereas I encountered some problems with Hugo.
1. Installing MathJax via Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation Everything you need can be found here. You have to insert the code below in the /layout/partials folder of your website: it is even better to create a file named mathjax_support.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website. I am David, PhD in mathematical physiology, especially in renal physiology and calcium/phosphate metabolism. I have a great interest for new technologies especially those dedicated to improve the learning process, as well as scientific collaboration. I often noticed that some scientific topics are really complex, thereby classical courses may not be sufficient to integrate all this complexity. During the past 5 years, I built several mathematical models from developmental biology (somitogenesis) to calcium and phosphate homeostasis.</description>
