      <description>The classical approach MathJax is a javascript library which allows the user to integrate math expressions in a website or a blog. However, its configuration can be quite complex for beginners. In my previous website powered by Jekyll, I easily managed to install MathJax, whereas I encountered some problems with Hugo.
1. Installing MathJax via Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation Everything you need can be found here. You have to insert the code below in the /layout/partials folder of your website: it is even better to create a file named mathjax_support.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website. I am David, PhD in mathematical physiology, especially in renal physiology and calcium/phosphate metabolism. I have a great interest for new technologies especially those dedicated to improve the learning process, as well as scientific collaboration. I often noticed that some scientific topics are really complex, thereby classical courses may not be sufficient to integrate all this complexity. During the past 5 years, I built several mathematical models from developmental biology (somitogenesis) to calcium and phosphate homeostasis.</description>
