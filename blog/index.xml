      <description>Introduction I recently created the RinteRface plateform in order to enhance the R shiny interface experience. Indeed, shiny is great, no doubts about that, yet the design might be sometimes quite redundant. There are currently some interesting libraries to improve shiny apps look such as shinymaterial, shiny.semantic, but this is definitely not enough.
Our Goal(s) RinteRface has 3 main goals:
 provide shiny with new original templates improving already existing templates (ie.</description>

      <description>This post is a copy and paste of an r-blogger article.
However, it is so useful that I keep it here to remember about the process to save and restore all R packages when updating to a newer version of R.
 Before you upgrade, build a temp file with all of your old packages.
tmp &amp;lt;- installed.packages() installedpkgs &amp;lt;- as.vector(tmp[is.na(tmp[,&amp;quot;Priority&amp;quot;]), 1]) save(installedpkgs, file=&amp;quot;installed_old.rda&amp;quot;)  Install the new version of R and let it do itâ€™s thing.</description>

      <description>A web tracking tool I often use is hotjar. Below is a heatmap showing all the users click in the past week in my personal website. I am keen on this kind of feedback since it summarizes everything at a glance. The screenshot you can see only takes into account click events. However, you can also see users moves or how they scroll on your website.

The table below shows where your visitors are from, how much time they spend on a given page, with which web browser and when.</description>

      <description>shinydashboardPlus  I recently released shinydashboardPlus on CRAN. Therefore, some of the functions below are now included in the package. Find out more on github.
Introduction shinydashboard is without any doubt a great package. Even though built upon the famous free adminLTE2 dashboard template (boostrap 3), most of the dashboard I see almost look the same. In the shinydashboard package, some adminLTE2 components are not implemented such as the right sidebar, which can be extremely useful: contains input, parameters, &amp;hellip; But everything you need is hidden under the hood, in the inst/AdminLTE folder (shinydashboard github).</description>

      <description>Introduction shiny basic package contains several widgets, available here. This database is continuously extended through the shinyWidget package developed by the dreamRs team. Here I present how we add a new knobInput widget to shinyWidget, with Victor Perrier from the dreamRs team.

      <description>Sometimes, you might get bored by the design of the sliders in Shiny. This input widget uses the Ion.Rangeslider js library. In the advanced section, you can notice that 5 themes are actually available. I really like the flat ui skin. In this tutorial, I will describe a way to choose new themes for your shiny sliders.
Use shinyWidgets Recently, I added 2 functions to the shinyWidgets package of dreamRs: - chooseSliderSkin to set the global skin of all your sliders.</description>

 hide/show/toggle widgets, graphs, tables reset inputs to their initial value enable/disable elements  These are the most noteworthy properties of this package and require just a few lines of code to work.</description>

      <description>The classical approach MathJax is a javascript library which allows the user to integrate math expressions in a website or a blog. However, its configuration can be quite complex for beginners. In my previous website powered by Jekyll, I easily managed to install MathJax, whereas I encountered some problems with Hugo.
1. Installing MathJax via Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation Everything you need can be found here. You have to insert the code below in the /layout/partials folder of your website: it is even better to create a file named mathjax_support.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website. I am David, PhD in mathematical physiology, especially in renal physiology and calcium/phosphate metabolism. I have a great interest for new technologies especially those dedicated to improve the learning process, as well as scientific collaboration. I often noticed that some scientific topics are really complex, thereby classical courses may not be sufficient to integrate all this complexity. During the past 5 years, I built several mathematical models from developmental biology (somitogenesis) to calcium and phosphate homeostasis.</description>
